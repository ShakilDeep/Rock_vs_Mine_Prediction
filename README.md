# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction


I'm thrilled to share that I have successfully developed a SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction model using Python and cutting-edge deep learning techniques, specifically incorporating linear regression. üåäüî¨

In this project, I leveraged the power of libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for seamless data handling and manipulation, ensuring optimal preprocessing of the SONAR signal dataset. I also utilized the train_test_split function from scikit-learn's model_selection module to split the data into training and testing sets, guaranteeing unbiased evaluation.

By implementing the LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn's linear_model module, I constructed a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and mines based on SONAR signals. Linear regression, adapted for binary classification, enabled me to predict the probability of a signal being a rock or a mine.

To evaluate the model's performance, I employed the accuracy_score metric from scikit-learn's metrics module. This provided valuable insights into the model's effectiveness by measuring the proportion of correctly classified instances in the testing set.

By merging deep learning and linear regression techniques, I have created a reliable and efficient system for SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction. üåä‚õèÔ∏è This development holds immense potential in various underwater applications, such as underwater exploration, security, and environmental monitoring.

I'm incredibly proud of the results achieved through this project and excited to continue exploring the possibilities of deep learning in underwater signal classification. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey into the fascinating world of data science and machine learning! ü§ñ‚ú®
